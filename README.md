CustomizedERP
=============
This is the prototyp resulting from my master thesis "ANFORDERUNGSANALYSE UND ENTWICKLUNG EINES ADAPTIVEN ERP-SYSTEMS FÃœR KLEINST- UND KLEINBETRIEBE IM EINZELHANDEL". 

This repository contains two Django web applications: 
- the coreproject is a ERP system and is used as a blue print for the erpConfigurator
- the erpConfigurator let you choose which ERP modules should be included in your ERP system and generates a new web application based on the coreproject and your choosen requirements
